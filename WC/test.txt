This WC program is counting the amount of characters in a test file!

To build, first run the command: cargo build --release
Then run this command to run the build: ./target/release/WC test.txt
This is calling the released executable and using the test.txt as an arguement.
After calling the WC executable, it should return Total number of characters: 479
When finished, run the command: cargo clean
This will remove the target and release. Making it easy to re-build a project.
